            <h2>February 15, 2012<br>Scott Sampson</h2>
            <p>What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops! Come to the Saroyan, armed
                with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the Utah Museum of Natural
                History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused on the ecology and evolution of late
                Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa.<br><br>Scott Sampson is
                a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Toronto. His
                doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids, or horned dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous
                of Montana, as well as the growth and function of certopsid horns and frills.<br><br> Following graduation in
                1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum of Natual History in New York City, followed
                by five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long
                Island. He arrived at the University of Utah accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the
                Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of
                Natural History. His research interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional morphology,
                and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.<br><br> In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies,
                Sampson has conducted paleontological work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the
                United States and Canada. He was also the on-the-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet
                and recently completed a book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life, which is one of the
                most comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.</p>
